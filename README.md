## About Laravel passport

In this tutorial, we will see how to use laravel passport authentication in your Laravel application. We will also build a simple Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) using Laravel Passport Authentication.

Laravel already provides tradition login forms authentication, but what if you want to use APIs? APIs use tokens for authenticating users, because they do not use sessions. When a user login via API, a token is generated and sent to the user which is used for authentication purposes. Laravel provides Passport to work with API Authentication without any difficulty.
